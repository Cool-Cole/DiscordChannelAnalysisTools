# Discord Channel Analysis Tools
These scripts are supposed to be paired with the JSON output of https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter

These scripts work with only one channel at a time.

I am pretty new at programming so cut me some slack.

P.S. - I think these scripts load the entire JSON file into RAM. Just keep this in mind if your JSON file is larger than the ammount of RAM you have.
